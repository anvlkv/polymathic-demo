# polymathic

polymathic is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) portfolio theme. 

I made it for my own portfolio. The theme is called `polymathic`, inspired by individuals with a wide range of talents. The theme focuses on rich and consistent navigation experience, exposing the variety of topics to chose from, yet allowing the user to focus on a single thread of your story once they've made a choice. 

This site is the docs & demo. This site itself uses the theme.

This theme uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) scss framework, making the theme [styles highly customizable](/docs/styles).

This theme uses [Animate.css](https://animate.style) for animations.

This theme adds minimal [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tags to every page `head`.

Besides the styles, you can [customize navigation](/docs/lvl1-nav), the theme relies on zola `[taxonomies]` and values you provide in `[extra.poly]`.

You can quickly deploy the theme to [netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/), theme comes with a config file.
