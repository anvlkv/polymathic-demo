```c

#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure for the Fish
struct Fish {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float length;
};

// Function to create a new Fish
struct Fish createFish(const char* name, int age, float length) {
    struct Fish newFish;
    snprintf(newFish.name, sizeof(newFish.name), "%s", name);
    newFish.age = age;
    newFish.length = length;
    return newFish;
}

// Function to display information about a Fish
void displayFish(struct Fish fish) {
    printf("Fish Name: %s\n", fish.name);
    printf("Fish Age: %d years\n", fish.age);
    printf("Fish Length: %.2f inches\n", fish.length);
}

int main() {
    // Create a Fish object
    struct Fish myFish = createFish("Nemo", 2, 5.5);

    // Display information about the Fish
    displayFish(myFish);
