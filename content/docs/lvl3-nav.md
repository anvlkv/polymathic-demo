# Shared taxonomies (level 3)

Once multiple **sections** appear in `menu_order` and are using same taxonomy in their `use_taxonomies`, then theme optimizes taxonomy terms view in all navigation. This is achieved by grouping reencountered terms under their common taxonomy name. Feel free to create an (issue)[https://github.com/anvlkv/polymathic/issues] in case this doesn't work for you.
