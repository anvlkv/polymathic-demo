# Shared taxonomies (level 3)

Once multiple **sections** appear in `menu_order` and are using same taxonomy in their `use_taxonomies`, then theme optimizes taxonomy terms view in all navigation. This is achieved by grouping reencountered terms under their common taxonomy name.

You may want to play with prioritizing of taxonomies in `use_taxonomies` as well as with order of taxonomy terms of your pages.
